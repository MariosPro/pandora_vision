        @brief Finds holes, provided a depth image in CV_32FC1 format.

        1. some basic eroding and dilation to eliminate isolated noise pixels.
        2. eliminate huge contours and tiny contours without filtering. There is no problem with the huge and no problem with the tiny for distances less than 2.5m (in any case, in such distances holes are not obvious at all).
        3. Eliminate contours which have an over 4x bounding box height/ width fraction or the inverse. There was no TP loss by this progress, instead wall edges were eliminated.
        4. Merge contours. Check only in small distance. Firstly label contours to merge together with a probability. The probability consists of a weighted sum of some features inside a box between the two contours' keypoints. Currently, features are the inverse of the euclidean distance between keypoints and the sum of blacks in the original image. 
        5. The contours checked at each step are those that were not eliminated by previous steps.
